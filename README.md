# The-Connect-Four

Connect Four is a two-player game where players drop colored discs into a vertically standing grid with the goal of being the first to get four of their own colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a game of strategy and foresight, requiring players to both plan their own moves and anticipate their opponent's.
